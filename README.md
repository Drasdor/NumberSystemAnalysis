# NumberSystemAnalysis
An analysis of number systems based on multiple factors

The aim of this project is to score different number systems on 3 main areas. The scores are from 0-1 with 1 being a perfect score and 0 being the worst score. The scores from each area is then averaged to get a final score. It is important to note that most number systems do not rank highly as a score of 1 is the theoretical best and is not possible to achieve. The areas for scoring are:

Character Points: Number systems that are able to represent numbers in as few characters as possible are more efficient hence are given more points. It is more important for more commonly used (smaller) numbers to be short than less commonly used numbers. Hence, there is bias towards smaller numbers

Unique Points: Number systems should be simple so have as few unique numbers included as possible.

Representable: Number systems should be able to represent fractions as numbers without using recurring symbols (i.e. being able to write 0.17). Larger fractions are more commonly used so are given more weighting. Only unit fractions are assessed.
